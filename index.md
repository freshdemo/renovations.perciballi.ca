### Summary ###

This is the overall review for renovations we had done to a house recently. Please see the [Categories link](https://renovations.perciballi.ca//categories/) at the top right for more details on everything below.

#### Good ####

- The contracts were clearly documented. 
- The work started quickly.
- We were upsold to use longer lasting and better materials.
- For the most part all of the installation work is quite good.

#### Bad ####

- Payments were demanded before completion and not in full amounts making it difficult to manage.
- The work too at least 600% longer than contracted for, and anticipated.
- Some of the iron work is rusting already.
- They are not standing by the iron work that is rusting already.
- They are threatening legal action if I don't pay the final installments, even though the steps are rusting.
- Working with the manager is difficult as he won't talk on the phone to resolve issues quickly.


### Contract Performance ###

Prior to signing the contracts we had several discussions about the completion time. We asked that the contractor order everything as soon as possible and provided full access to an empty two car garage for the duration of the contract to store materials and equipment.

The contract for the back and side of the house was signed October 12 ,2020, with an estimated four weeks to complete. On June 20, 2021 this is technically not complete due to the fact that the light in the extension has not been installed. It seems they lost a piece of the bracket while moving it, but we are not entirely sure because nobody is responding to our requests to re-install it. Otherwise the rest of this work was completed around May 20, 2021 as we waited for the cladding to be installed and a few other small issues.

The contract for the decks was signed October 25, 2020, with an estimated four weeks to complete. We then forcasted a date of December 25, 2020 to complete to give them a 200% buffer for unforseen delays. Technically the installations completed around May 20, 2021 while we waited a long time to finish the railings and privacy screens, however we are still considering the project to be ongoing due to persistent rust on the front ungalvanized steele front stair case. Approximately 24 weeks instead of the 4 contracted, or 600% over schedule.

The only additional costs were silly but manageable; Approximately $200 for the trim in the extension, $300 to reinstall the electrical work in the extension, $150 to put a door under the front deck where there was one on the original deck. So maybe 1.5% greater than the estimated cost.
### Other Oddities ###

- We didn't expect the front and back landscaping to be destroyed.
- Branches from a tree in the backyard ended up needing to be cut down. We had discussed several times wanting to leave the tree as is as it was just recently trimmed. I also had to tell the manager about it. They cut the branches but refussed to remove them and I had to bring an arborist in to do that.
- The manager hasn't been here once since they deemed the work complete, and really hasn't been here beyond the first two months. This left me having to ask more questions than I planned on doing and having to point out deficiencies constantly that I would have expected him to be doing as part of quality control.

The reviews on Home Stars show very well, but they are all for a single deck type job. This included two decks, and extension, and tearing up concrete along the side of the house to create a French drain. Maybe this was too much.
