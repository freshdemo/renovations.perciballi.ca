<p>
This summary is focussed on the outstanding issues and payments. The contract for the Back was signed October 12, 2020 and contracted to be completed in 3 weeks. The contract for the Decks was signed October 26, 2020 and was contracted to be completed in four weeks. We are at 34 weeks and counting.
</p>

<p>I have been very clear and articulate about the fact that I am more than happy to pay for the work once it is completed, and without deficiency. My preference would have been for this to all be completed back in December 2020, but here we are.
</p>
 
<p>The total amount for the contracts are; Back - $16,046 & Decks - $35,256 including HST (which Manager guaranteed I would only pay half of). A total of $$43922.80 has been paid so far (minus the additional costs that came up along the way including things that don't make sense like electician). <b>The delta is $7379.20, however the design discount and HST discounts have not been taken into consideration.</b>

<ul>
 <li>April 17 - Manager asks for remainder of payment for back contract. Manager is advised that the ceiling light still has not been deployed. He acknoledges and agrees, <b>however to date the ceiling light is still not installed</b>
 <li>April 22 - Manager's first threat of legal action.

 <li>April 23 - In response to the legal threat, the following deficiency list is sent to Manager, clearly nowhere near completed. The issue is that Manager has not been to the site in months.

<pre>
 For the remaining payment of $3390 the following needs to be completed and addressed:
Privacy screens are not drilled to the front or rear deck.
Privacy screen slats in the back are not complete.
The gate that was broken while being moved needs to be repaired.
Air conditioner needs to be reinstalled and working.
We require the paint colors/codes for the white on the ceiling, and the iron out front.
At the front of the house there is a gap of 2-3 inches between the deck and the house. Is this considered complete? Is there a reason for it?

A discount of at least $100 should be applied for the following (photos are attached):
The door under the stairs is nowhere near worth $150. A hole was cut and hinges installed but no latch was installed to keep it closed. It took your guy less than an hour.
Several tiles in the backyard were broken and need to be replaced. I'm not interested in you doing this work.

For the remaining $5000 this is what needs to be completed:
Iron railing needs to be drilled to the front deck.
Iron railings cables need to be installed.
</pre>
 <li>May 28 - Manager is advised that <b>the ceiling light is still not installed</b>, and that he will need to exercise patience since at this point <b>he has been given two additional attemps at resolving rust on the ungalvanized stair case and we will need time to see if their efforts are effective.</b> Manager has not responded to this message.
</li>
