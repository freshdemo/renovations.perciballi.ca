<p>
This summary is focussed on the outstanding issues and payments. The contract for the Back was signed October 12, 2020 and contracted to be completed in 3 weeks. The contract for the Decks was signed October 26, 2020 and was contracted to be completed in four weeks. We are at 34 weeks and counting.
</p>

<p>I have been very clear and articulate about the fact that I am more than happy to pay for the work once it is completed, and without deficiency. My preference would have been for this to all be completed back in December 2020, but here we are.
</p>
 
<p>The total amount for the contracts are; Back - $16,046 & Decks - $35,256 including HST (which Manager guaranteed I would only pay half of). A total of $$43922.80 has been paid so far (minus the additional costs that came up along the way including things that don't make sense like electician). <b>The delta is $7379.20, however the design discount and HST discounts have not been taken into consideration.</b>

<ul>
 <li>Part of the scope of work was to deploy a French drain at the north side of the house. The concrete was leaning towards the house, and water would pool there. The contractor said a French drain would resolve this.
 <li>A French drain is typically supposed to be 18-24 inches under gravel, and the egress for the water should be at least 10 feet from the home.
 <li>As depicted below the drain is neither 18 inches deep nor is it 10 feet from the house.

<h2>Additional Cost Summary</h2>

<p>
To implement a proper drainage system the cost will be approximately $3390 including HST.

<p>
Here is a quote to resolve this in the most basic way, which involves re-digging the hole, implementing a basin, and implementing an egress pipe.
